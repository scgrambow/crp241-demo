## Note on how instructions are given (voice)

In the video, the Copilot prompts are dictated via voice using the Wispr
voice‑to‑text app. Spoken instructions are transcribed to text and then sent to
GitHub Copilot Chat. If you hear speech instead of typing, that’s intentional —
the workflow supports natural‑language dictation as well as typed prompts.
