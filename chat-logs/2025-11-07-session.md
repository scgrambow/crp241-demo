# Chat Session Log – 2025-11-07

Repository: crp241-demo (branch: main)
Date: 2025-11-07


## Overview

This session covered: aligning `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`,
updating `README.md` to explain dual instruction files, planning a course-pack
(Quarto book) structure, and guidance on saving chat logs.


## Key Actions Completed

- Synced instruction files: added cross-references, assumptions, canonical
  examples.
- Normalized typography and prompts in `AGENTS.md`.
- Expanded `README.md` with dual-instruction rationale and quick start
  sections.
- Proposed modular course structure with `lectures/`, `tutorials/`,
  `assignments/`, `scripts/`, `data/` and Quarto book config.
- Provided saving strategies for chat logs.


## Proposed Course Pack Structure (Quarto Book)

```text
_quarto.yml
index.qmd
lectures/
  01-introduction.qmd
  02-descriptive-stats.qmd
  05-confounding.qmd
scripts/
  10-27-25-confounding.R
  11-03-25-ancova.R
tutorials/
  10-27-25-confounding-tutorial.qmd
  11-03-25-ancova-tutorial.qmd
assignments/
  assignment-1.qmd
  assignment-2.qmd
data/
README.md
AGENTS.md
.github/copilot-instructions.md
```


## Copilot Instruction Extensions (Future)

Add sections for:

- Generating lecture chapters from transcripts.
- Creating assignments from lectures.
- Quarto book configuration and cross-referencing.


## Next Suggested Steps

1. Add `_quarto.yml` scaffold and `index.qmd`.
2. Move or copy existing tutorial QMDs into `tutorials/` directory.
3. Draft first lecture chapter (convert transcript) and first assignment.
4. Extend instruction files with lecture/assignment generation rules.
5. Render the book and validate navigation + cross-references.


## Notes

You can iterate tomorrow by supplying a sample transcript for conversion. This
log preserves today’s architectural decisions.
