# Chat Session Log – 2026-01-07

## Overview

This session focused on preparing teaching materials for a linear regression model (BMI vs Alcohol consumption). The workflow included cleaning an original R script for a physician audience, generating a matching Quarto tutorial, and refining instructional guidelines based on technical and statistical corrections.

## Key Actions Completed

- **Linear Regression Material Cleanup**:
  - Improved [new files/01-12-26-linear-reg-Rscript-revised.R](new files/01-12-26-linear-reg-Rscript-revised.R) with physician-friendly documentation, numbered sections, and clinical interpretations.
  - Created [new files/01-12-26-linear-reg-Rscript-tutorial.qmd](new files/01-12-26-linear-reg-Rscript-tutorial.qmd) which renders to HTML and PDF formats.
- **Statistical & Technical Corrections**:
  - Corrected Mean BMI value from 27.6 to **27.8** based on dataset verification.
  - Standardized terminology to use **"sample"** or **"group"** instead of "population" for statistics derived from the study sample.
  - Identified and documented **63 missing values** (NAs) in the BMI variable.
  - Added programming callouts explaining the use of `use = "complete.obs"`.
- **Instructional Architecture Updates**:
  - Updated [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and [.github/copilot-instructions.md](.github/copilot-instructions.md) to encode new principles for future model interactions.

## Architectural Changes & Updates

Based on the refinements in this session, the following rules were added to the global instruction files:

1.  **Terminology Discipline**: Future agents must strictly distinguish between **sample** statistics and **population** parameters.
2.  **Missing Data Requirement**: Agents must now explicitly check for and report the frequency of missing values and explain handling methods (e.g., `na.rm` or `complete.obs`).
3.  **Data Verification**: A new acceptance check requires agents to verify key summary statistics (means, counts) against the actual dataset before writing interpretations.
4.  **Programming Callouts**: Standardized the use of `callout-important` for technical or programming-specific notes.
